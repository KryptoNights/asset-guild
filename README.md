# Secure marketplace for your assets
Sell pay-to-view content without leaking them


A decentralized, Ethereum-centric pay-to-view platform for content creators and consumers, leveraging advanced cryptographic techniques and layer 2 solutions.

## Overview

Our platform allows content creators to easily monetize their work while providing consumers with a seamless way to access high-quality, watermark-free content. By leveraging blockchain technology, layer 2 solutions, and advanced encryption techniques, we ensure a secure, scalable, and privacy-preserving ecosystem for all users.

## Features

- **Decentralized Payments**: Connect your wallet using Dynamic for easy, secure transactions.
- **Content Monetization**: Upload your content, set your price, and start earning.
- **Watermark Removal**: Consumers can unlock and view non-watermarked content after payment.
- **Identity Verification**: Worldcoin integration for secure, privacy-preserving identity verification.
- **Layer 2 Deployment**: Utilizes Arbitrum Sepolia for scalability and cost-efficiency.
- **Fully Homomorphic Encryption**: Ensures data privacy throughout the entire process.
- **Circle Integration**: For stable and reliable payment processing.

## Technical Implementation

### Ethereum Foundation Integration
The project is built with a strong focus on Ethereum, leveraging its robust ecosystem and tools. Our smart contracts and overall architecture are designed to be fully compatible with the Ethereum network and its standards.

### Arbitrum Sepolia Deployment
- Smart contracts are deployed on Arbitrum Sepolia, a layer 2 solution for enhanced scalability and reduced transaction costs.
- Implementation includes creating developer-controlled wallets and key management.
- The deployment process involves:
  1. Wallet preparation
  2. Funding wallets
  3. Contract deployment using transient encrypted public keys

### Circle Integration
- Utilizes Circle's infrastructure for stable and efficient payment processing.
- Ensures seamless transactions between fiat and cryptocurrency.

### Fhenix Integration (Fully Homomorphic Encryption)
- Implements fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) to ensure data privacy and security.
- Custom derived encryption for strings using simple symmetric encryption on-chain.
- Utilizes sealed outputs and encrypted inputs to prevent data leakage at any point.
- Tested and validated on a local network before deployment on Fhenix Helium.

## How It Works

### For Content Creators

1. Verify your identity using Worldcoin's World ID.
2. Upload your content to the platform.
3. Set your desired price for the content.
4. Content is encrypted using FHE techniques.
5. Start earning as users purchase access to your work.

### For Content Consumers

1. Browse available content on the platform.
2. Connect your wallet using Dynamic.
3. Purchase access to desired content through Circle integration.
4. Securely decrypt and enjoy watermark-free, high-quality content.

## Getting Started
